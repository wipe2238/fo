## CheckUndatUI()

Files extracted by UndatUI from Fallout1 (Steam);
checked against `GetBytesReal()`

Due to size, these files are **not** a part of repository and need to be extracted manually.
As UndatUI adds `data/` prefix to extract path, valid dir structure is `dat/testdata/undatui/data/ART/...`
